  Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting 
  behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular 
  value or infinity. In computer science, it is used to classify 
  algorithms according to their running time or space requirements.
Formula:                         # (Optional) If there's a primary formula
  Representation: "T(n) = O(f(n))"
  Explanation: |                 # (Optional) Explanation of the formula
    Where T(n) is the time taken by an algorithm for an input size of n, 
    and f(n) is a function that describes the growth rate of the time.
