## Instructions

Place this file in the 'Definitions' directory of your project's file tree.

## Description

This folder serves as a centralized repository for definitions and terminology across various computer science and related subjects. It's organized into subfolders based on specific topics, providing a structured approach to learning and referencing key concepts.

## ACM Classification Files

* `acm_classification.md`: The original list of topics extracted from the ACM 2023 curriculum.
* `acm_details.md`: A detailed breakdown of topics and their associated subjects from the ACM curriculum.
* `acm_suggested_folder_directory.md`: The final suggested directory structure, consolidating related subjects into cohesive topics.

## Subfolders

* **Applied_CS:** Definitions related to the practical applications of computer science.
 * **Business:**
     * **Healthcare:**
